# Numida Tech Assessment
This is a simple react native app which allows users to apply for loans. It has the following functionality
- View loan products
- Apply for loans
- View existing applications
- Simple navigation
- Error handling
- Loading states
- and more


# Getting Started

## Step 1: Install dependencies
```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```
then
```bash
cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install
```

## Step 2: Start Metro

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

## Congratulations! :tada:
